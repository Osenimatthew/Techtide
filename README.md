Working on TechTunes has been a rewarding experience, providing hands-on exposure to the complexities of developing a dynamic web application. The project highlighted the importance of effective collaboration and time management, especially when working with tight deadlines. It also offered a deep dive into integrating third-party APIs, managing user data with Firebase, and designing a responsive interface.

While there were challenges, such as handling API rate limits and ensuring cross-browser compatibility, they served as opportunities for growth and learning. Overall, the project strengthened skills in front-end development, problem-solving, and user-centered design. Moving forward, I am excited to continue building upon this project and exploring new features to enhance the user experience.
